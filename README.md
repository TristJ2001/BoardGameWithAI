# BoardGameWithAI
This game was created in my first semester of third year of study. We had to design our own 2D board game and implement an AI to play against. It was designed to get us used to implementing AI algorithms into our games. Both the minimax algorithm, as well as QLearning were used to generate the AI's moves.
